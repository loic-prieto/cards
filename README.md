Card game framework
=====

A framework to be able to play card games online with friends. Very free form, as magic workstation. The players themselves
set the rules and the framework just visualizes it. Configuration data and content must be provided by the player.

An initial AI is expected to be done for the WOW TCG as it is the game I like the most.

On the technological front, the game uses a client done in java, with the Slick 2D framework, and a server done in pure 
java that will host multiplayer games. No connection will be needed to play offline games with the AI or to build decks.
